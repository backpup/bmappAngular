## Bookmark app in angularJS

BookmarkApp 2.0 (I guess) with angularJS and bootstrap. After having spent some time learning angular, I am feeling a little confident, so decided to redo the app with it.

This project will be inserted as a submodule in the already created bookmark project. Instead of the previous js/jquery code, this will drive the application with some more routes defined in the laravel project for the $resource service.
